### **About**

---

Metarina is the booking platform to connect boaters directly to industry-leading marinas. By providing marinas with an operating system that automatically aggregates booking channels, they can grow their business and become operationally efficient. This marina manager is the foundation for Metarina to equip boaters with a berth booking tool that ensures safe and reliable planning when sailing from marina to marina.

### **Status**

---

The Germany-based tech platform launched its channel manager in the western Mediterranean in a beta version during its German governmental “EXIST” funding, with now almost 1000 marinas listed. A pre-seed funding round was subsequently closed by industry experts and like-minded business angels, family office and experienced entrepreneurs. Metarina will steer the fresh capital towards growing the team to expand to all European coasts. Also, the team will continue to advance the product development of its holistic software platform to make it easier for boaters and marinas to make direct bookings.

### **Background**

---

Metarina originated from a recurring struggle on the high seas in the Mediterranean at the end of 2019. At the time, two of the co-founders, as crew of a traditional sailing yacht, found it to be extremely difficult to reliably book a safe harbour. Since then, the then captain Nicola Kienzle, tech entrepreneur Henry Hooper, and senior developer Leon Entrup have been working on creating the optimal link between marinas and boaters. Together they form the backbone to disrupt the boating world, a sector that is just starting to catch up with the digital transformation of the last decades. With their deep industry knowledge the team has understood and validated the key challenges of marinas not being able to plan their resources optimally. With Metarina, the trio seeks to counter that challenge and to have a lasting and sustainable impact on the entire sector.

### **Values**

---

- **We include.** From the very beginning, we have always included all stakeholders without prejudice and with an open mind. Only with such an inclusive approach and mutual trust can a lasting impact be made together.
- **We contribute.** Many individuals have selflessly propelled Metarina’s progress forward. For this we are grateful and constantly motivated to give back to our community.
- **We simplify.** Just like we all value the sense of freedom that the ocean gives, our solution-oriented team wants our customers to feel relieved with Metarina by their side. Only if we provide simplicity and peace of mind to everyone involved, can we add real value.
- **We care.** Every single customer, supplier, employee, colleague or friend has needs. These need to be brought into harmony in order to work together for a better future.
